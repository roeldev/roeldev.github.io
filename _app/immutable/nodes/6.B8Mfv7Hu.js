It truly has been a long time coming. After a short downtime of almost 6 years, it's
			time for a comeback.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Let me briefly introduce myself. Hi, I'm Roel, a software and DevOps engineer from the Netherlands. Over the last
			20 years I have built up experience in various programming languages and environments. Currently, my main focus is
			on developing cloud-native/distributed applications using Go and container technologies such as Docker and
			Kubernetes. I'm a big fan of the <a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">12factor
				app</a> and use DevOps/GitOps principles wherever they are a good fit.</p> <p>I'm also a creator/maintainer of several opensource <a href="https://github.com/roeldev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/go-pogo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">packages</a>, and I love to tinker with
			all kinds of tech-related stuff. Of course, as a tech enthusiast, I also have an overpowered homelab and a
			decent amount of smart home tech installed in my house. The homelab runs Kubernetes based on Talos Linux and was
			featured on <a href="https://www.siderolabs.com/blog/talos-home-lab-clusters/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sidero Labs' blog</a> (scroll to the "Supermicro + Proxmox" heading). This is actually
			an older setup which has changed quite a bit; more on that later...</p> <h2 id="a-long-time-ago">A long time ago...</h2> <p>According to the whois information, I registered the domain name roelschut.nl on February 4th of 2012. Looking at
			the Wayback Machine, the first actual website appeared not until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141012214452/http://roelschut.nl/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">October
				2014</a>. Before that it would redirect any visitor to another website of mine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109220523/http://roelschut-fotografie.nl/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">roelschut-fotografie.nl</a>.</p> <p>Several different iterations using different backends/frontends have been in development, but none of them ever
			really went past the alpha phase. Somewhere in January of 2019 I decided to just pull the plug and redirect the
			domain to my LinkedIn page. Frontend development was not something I enjoyed much anymore. The focus of my career
			shifted from being a full-stack web developer to a backend developer to a software and DevOps engineer.</p> <h2 id="the-future">The future</h2> <p>This time I'll try to keep it relatively simple so I can focus on creating some interesting content. So (note to
			self), I won't be using a (self-created) CMS or any other fancy backend solutions. It's just TailwindCSS for basic
			styling together with Svelte, which I really like so far. Actually, as of writing, the website is statically
			generated using SvelteKit and is hosted using GitHub Pages. A pretty simple solution until I find a good way to
			safely expose my internal Kubernetes cluster to the big bad internet.</p> <p>Content I want to write about are some how-to/tutorial-based articles on a more regular basis, based on
			techniques/tools I use myself. The first is almost finished and features setting up Traefik with a
			custom root certificate on TrueNAS. Another one I'm working on will be about creating a Talos Kubernetes cluster
			on bare-metal machines using Omni.</p> <p>I've got a gazillion other ideas, so if you're into this kind of stuff, make sure to keep an eye out :)</p></div>`);function d(e){r(e,{children:(t,s)=>{var o=i();n(t,o)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}export{d as component};
